== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is RSVPMaker required? =

RSVPMaker provides the basic functionality for creating, editing, and displaying event posts. By default, it collects a yes/no response to an event (and, optionally, a PayPal payment). This Toastmasters extension allows the software to collect signups for specific roles.

RSVPMaker includes many features you will not use in the course of a regular Toastmasters meeting, but you may have open house events or seminars you might want to advertise as events on your website. 

= How is the version hosted at wp4toastmasters.com different? =

Toastmasters clubs can get free websites hosted as subdomains of [wp4toastmasters.com](http://wp4toastmasters.com/). This is using the WordPress Multisite version of WordPress, meaning that all sites hosted in this fashion run on the same instance of the software, with the network administrator controlling what plugins and themes are available. This is how WordPress.com, the service provided by the creators of the software, functions.

When you install this software on your own website, you have greater freedom to install other plugins or themes, including those of your own design.

You can purchase hosting through [wp4toastmasters.com](http://wp4toastmasters.com/), which is a way of supporting the author of this software and getting the most direct technical support.
